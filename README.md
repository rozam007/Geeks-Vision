This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server: 

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev 
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```  
 
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. 

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Deploy on Hostinger

It is a three step process to deploy your nextjs app to hostinger

- Add (output: 'export') in nextConfig object in next.config.mjs file
- create .htaccess folder on root level place below .htaccess content inside it
- create production build for app using "npm run build", out directly will be created if command finishes its execution
- now you need to export all files within out directory and .htaccess file to hostinger

## .htaccess content

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
